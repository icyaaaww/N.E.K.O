"""The single locale normalizer for every prompt module.

Prompt modules used to carry six hand-rolled normalizers that disagreed on
empty-input defaults, Steam alias handling, whitespace, and whether the
Traditional Chinese branch survived. This module owns the one implementation;
the differences that were deliberate are now explicit keyword arguments.

Three axes cover every prompt module's needs:

``default``
    What an empty / missing language resolves to. Most prompt modules want
    ``"en"``; the minigame modules intentionally default to Chinese because
    their helper text is hardcoded Chinese-flavored.

``simplified``
    The dict key Simplified Chinese is stored under. Most prompt dicts use the
    short ``"zh"``; the badminton quick-lines table keys Simplified Chinese as
    the full ``"zh-CN"``.

``keep_traditional``
    Whether ``zh-TW`` survives as its own key. The shared ``_loc`` resolver
    independently uses Simplified Chinese as its safety fallback when a Chinese
    variant key is absent, so ``False`` is never a correctness hazard — it just
    keeps the module's intended locale key explicit.

    Every prompt dict under config/prompts/ now carries a ``'zh-TW'`` template
    (issue #2500 step 1), so template coverage is no longer what gates the flag.
    ``prompts_minigame_common`` flipped to ``True`` in issue #2500 step 2, in the
    same change that moved its game-route call sites to the full locale. That
    pairing is the rule: flipping earlier is a no-op, because the callers' SHORT
    code has already collapsed the script before it reaches this function, and
    switching the callers first without flipping hands Traditional users a
    resolver that silently drops it.

    ``prompts_proactive._normalize_prompt_language`` is the one template-selecting
    ``False`` left, waiting on its own call-site flip in
    ``main_logic/proactive_chat/service.py``.

    ``prompts_directives._trim_term`` passes ``False`` for an
    unrelated reason and stays that way: it is picking a *particle table family*,
    and Traditional and Simplified Chinese share one. See issue #2500.

Unlike ``config._runtime.normalize_language_code``, this normalizer is
self-contained: it never routes through the runtime-injected forwarder, so a
bare ``import`` in a test resolves Steam codes exactly the way the running app
does.
