# Memory event journal: implemented design record

This page records the event-journal design that is implemented in the current
memory subsystem. It is intentionally an architectural record, not a line-by-line
construction plan. For the user-facing lifecycle, start with
[Memory System](/architecture/memory-system).

## Status and scope

Each character can have an append-only `events.ndjson` journal and an
`events_applied.json` replay sentinel beside its JSON views. The journal gives
selected evidence and lifecycle mutations an ordered audit trail and a recovery
path if the process stops after the event is durable but before the view or an
archive shard is complete.

The JSON views remain the live read models. This is **not full event sourcing**,
and the current journal does **not** cover every mutation in facts, reflections,
persona, recent history, or time-indexed storage.

## Problem it solves

Atomic JSON replacement protects one file, but a memory transition may span a
view, an archive shard, and related lifecycle state. Without an independent
ordered record, a crash between those writes can leave no reliable way to tell
which mutation was intended.

For the covered paths, the journal provides three guarantees:

1. The intended mutation reaches disk before the live view changes.
2. Startup can replay an unapplied event through an idempotent handler.
3. Causal ordering is preserved: replay stops at the first event it cannot apply.

## On-disk layout

```text
memory/<character>/events.ndjson
memory/<character>/events_applied.json
```

Each non-empty journal line is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid4",
  "type": "reflection.evidence_updated",
  "ts": "2026-07-16T12:34:56.123456",
  "payload": {}
}
```

File position defines event order. `ts` is local naive ISO 8601 metadata and is
not used as the ordering key. Payloads are event-specific. Evidence updates are
mostly identifier and counter snapshots; archive recovery events can contain a
full derived entry snapshot, including text, so the character memory directory
must be treated as user-sensitive data.

## Current event coverage

`memory/event_log.py` declares 15 event names, but production startup currently
registers replay handlers for only these five:

| Event | Current use |
|---|---|
| `reflection.evidence_updated` | Evidence counters, decay bookkeeping, and promotion retry state |
| `persona.evidence_updated` | Persona evidence counters and archive countdown state |
| `persona.entry_updated` | Merge-on-promote text rewrite, evidence snapshot, and `merged_from_ids` |
| `reflection.state_changed` | Reflection lifecycle changes and reflection archive recovery |
| `persona.fact_added` | Persona archive recovery when the payload contains an archive snapshot |

The remaining declared names are reserved or legacy vocabulary:
`fact.added`, `fact.absorbed`, `fact.archived`, `reflection.synthesized`,
`reflection.surfaced`, `reflection.rebutted`, `persona.fact_mentioned`,
`persona.suppressed`, `correction.queued`, and `correction.resolved`.
They do not currently have production replay handlers. New code must not emit one
of these names merely because it appears in `ALL_EVENT_TYPES`; a recoverable
writer requires both a producer and a registered, idempotent handler.

## Write contract

Covered mutations use `EventLog.record_and_save()` or its async twin. One
per-character `threading.Lock` contains the complete synchronous critical section:

```text
load current view
  -> append event, flush, fsync
  -> mutate the loaded view
  -> atomically save the view
  -> atomically advance the sentinel
```

The async twin moves that entire block to one worker thread. Callers may use an
outer per-character `asyncio.Lock` for manager-level serialization, but they must
not hold the journal's threading lock across an `await`.

Appending first is deliberate. If append or `fsync` fails, the shared in-memory
view has not changed. If mutation or view save fails after append, the durable
event remains available for startup replay.

Unknown event names are rejected at append time. This prevents a new writer from
creating an event that the current binary cannot replay.

## Startup recovery

During memory-server startup, the runtime:

1. creates the managers, `EventLog`, and `Reconciler`;
2. registers the current evidence/lifecycle handlers;
3. reconciles every configured character, awaited to completion;
4. scans pending outbox work and spawns replay tasks;
5. runs evidence and archive migrations, then starts the staggered background
   loops.

Reconciliation before outbox replay is deliberate and load-bearing. Both write the
same view files, but their read points are asymmetric: a replay handler loads,
mutates, and saves inside the `EventLog` lock, while the reflection and persona
live writers load the whole snapshot *outside* that lock and only then hand it to
`record_and_save`. Any overlap therefore leaves a window where a live writer saves
a pre-replay snapshot back over a just-completed repair, with the sentinel already
past the event — silent, permanent loss. Resumed outbox operations are background
tasks, and reconciliation is fully awaited, so running reconciliation first removes
the overlap entirely.

The reverse dependency does not exist: a resumed operation emits its own events
through `record_and_save`, which appends, applies, and saves as one step, so
reconciliation never has to apply them afterwards. Code still must not depend on an
outbox side effect being visible to any later startup step: `_replay_pending_outbox()`
returns the spawned task list, and the startup caller does not await it, so those
operations may overlap migrations and early loop activity.

The reconciler reads events after `last_applied_event_id` and applies them in file
order. A handler must load, idempotently apply, and persist its view before it
returns. The sentinel advances only after successful return.

If a handler raises, or the journal contains a type without a registered handler,
replay stops for that character and leaves the sentinel at the last successful
event. It does not skip ahead, because later transitions may depend on the failed
one. Restarting retries the same tail after the underlying problem is fixed.

A missing, malformed, or no-longer-present sentinel falls back to replaying the
current journal body. Handlers therefore have to tolerate duplicate application.

## Cross-file archive recovery

Reflection and persona archival intentionally commit in this order:

```text
journal event + active-view removal
  -> append full entry to the selected archive shard
```

The event carries the chosen shard basename and an entry snapshot. If the process
stops between the two steps, the replay handler can recreate the missing shard
entry. Archive append and replay are idempotent, so retry does not intentionally
create duplicate logical entries.

## Compaction

`EventLog` contains a compaction helper that can replace a journal with a bounded
set of snapshot seed events after 10,000 lines or when the oldest readable event
is at least 90 days old. The replacement uses a temporary file plus
`os.replace`, then resets the sentinel so the seeds replay.

This helper is **not currently called by the memory-server startup or background
loops**. The thresholds describe available infrastructure, not an active retention
policy. Operators should not assume deployed journals are automatically compacted.

## Concurrency and consistency boundaries

- Locking is per character and in process. There is no cross-process distributed
  lock or multi-writer protocol.
- View files remain authoritative for normal reads and may still be repaired or
  migrated directly by dedicated code.
- The sentinel write is an unconditional overwrite. Event ids are UUIDs, so no
  writer can tell from two ids which is newer; the only order that exists is the
  position in the journal. `record_and_save` can never rewind it, since it writes
  the id it just appended. Replay cannot make that assumption, so it compares the
  on-disk sentinel against the value its round started from — before it runs the
  handler, not after — and neither applies the event nor writes the sentinel when
  they differ.
- A replay round that loses that comparison does not stop, and does not keep
  applying the list it was holding. Either would lose data. The list is now
  *behind* another writer's sentinel, so applying it as-is pushes older payloads
  over that writer's values, and the newer event sits ahead of the frozen sentinel
  where no later boot replays it. Stopping instead abandons repairs that the same
  sentinel write has already made unreplayable. So the round re-reads the journal
  from its own last-applied position through to the end of the file and replays
  that range in journal order: the queued repairs land, the other writer's events
  land after them, and the newest payload for any given entry wins. The sentinel
  stays frozen — rewinding it would return the other writer's events to the tail,
  and one without a registered handler wedges every later boot — and needs no
  final write, because that writer already parked it at the journal end. Replaying
  an already-applied event is harmless for the same reason a missing sentinel
  triggers a full replay: handlers carry full snapshots and are idempotent.
- That "end of the file" is a snapshot, and writers keep appending past it. An
  event landing after the snapshot is absent from the range being replayed, while
  the stale payloads queued ahead of it are not: replaying those pushes older
  values over the view that writer just saved, and the sentinel now parked on its
  id means no later boot replays it back. So the frozen pass re-probes from its
  own last-applied position each time it drains, and only returns once a probe
  comes back empty. The probe count is bounded (`_MAX_FROZEN_RESCANS`) so that
  unbroken write traffic ends the round instead of stalling startup; hitting the
  bound is logged, because whatever is left unreplayed sits behind the sentinel
  and no later boot picks it up.
- **Known limitation, not fixed here.** Advancing the sentinel to the journal end
  asserts that every earlier event was applied, and `record_and_save` never checks
  that. Whenever an unapplied tail is on disk — replay paused on an unregistered
  event type or a raising handler — the next live write silently orphans it. This
  is unrelated to reconciliation running concurrently, and startup ordering does
  not help. Closing it requires the sentinel to stop being "an event id": either a
  full journal scan on every write, or a position/applied-set with an on-disk
  format migration. Until then, do not read "the sentinel only moves forward" as
  "no event can be skipped".
- Outbox recovery and event replay solve different failure windows: the outbox
  retries background operations; the journal repairs covered mutations after the
  operation has chosen a concrete state transition.
- Events outside the five registered production handlers are not currently a
  general audit/rebuild mechanism.
