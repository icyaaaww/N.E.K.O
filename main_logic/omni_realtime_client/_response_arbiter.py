# whose terminal event never arrives must not hold the lane forever on an
# otherwise healthy connection, so past its allowance its id stops holding the
# lane and a timer re-runs the release check — but the transport forwards no
# per-response activity signal that could distinguish a lost terminal from a
# slow live response, so the bound must grant a server response at least the
# same allowance an owned response gets (it ratchets up to the largest
# per-ticket ``response_done_timeout`` this arbiter has been asked to honor).
# Evicting sooner would reopen the lane under a still-running response and the
# next queued response.create would collide with it (response_already_active).
# The residual trade-off is deliberate: a live server response outliving the
# allowance can still be presumed dead, but the alternative — holding the lane
# until a terminal that may never come — reintroduces the permanent wedge this
# bound exists to prevent, and a waiter behind a genuinely long lane hits the

        Some providers begin answering when they receive the conversation
        item and never wait for ``response.create``. Their announcement then
        arrives while ``_process`` still holds the item-ack barrier, with no
        owner assigned, and is booked as server-initiated — after which the
        request's own create is never announced and its started timeout tears
        the transport down. Every turn, on every such provider.

        Never consulted before this request's own ``response.create`` has gone
        out and produced nothing. That is the discriminator, and nothing
        cheaper works: an announcement arriving between our item and its ack
        is, on the evidence available at that instant, identical whether it is
        our own echo or an automatic response the user triggered. What
        separates them is what our create then does — a provider already busy
        with someone else's response REJECTS it, and a provider that accepts it
        ANNOUNCES it. Either resolves ``started`` and this is never reached.
        Only the create that was silently redundant leaves us here.

        Both moments that qualify ask the same question, because a provider
        that answers the item directly may finish before our started allowance
        expires: the unclaimed announcement's own terminal, and the started
        timeout itself.

        Claiming it back is still only safe against evidence this request
        collected itself, so all of the following must also hold:

        - **The provider acknowledged an item while this request held the
          lane.** ``conversation.item.created`` is the only positive sign the
          announcement answers something this request sent. Deliberately not
          the item ACK: providers that assign their own item ids never match
          it, and the free routes are exactly those — requiring the ack would
          disqualify every request on the only providers that need this.
        - **Exactly one unowned announcement arrived in the window.** Two is
          ambiguous, and an id-less one cannot be named at all; the serial
          counts both, so either refuses adoption.
        - **The server-VAD correlation state did not move.** An automatic
          response announced across this window is the user's, not ours — and
          the pending marker being armed or its backstop expiring both mean
          exactly that.
        - **The id is still believed live.** An announcement whose terminal
          already arrived is finished business; adopting it would resolve this
          request against a response that has already ended.
