# Explicit, because `websockets.exceptions` is NOT reachable as a lazy
# attribute on the package (measured on 15.0.1: it raises AttributeError
# until some submodule import pulls it in). `handle_messages` names it in
# except clauses, and today those only resolve because `connect()` ran
# first and imported `websockets.asyncio.client` as a side effect. That
# holds in production and does not hold anywhere else — a test driving
# the receive loop over a fake socket hits AttributeError inside the
# except clause instead of the handler it was reaching for.
