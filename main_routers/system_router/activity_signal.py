    """Accept OS-activity signals pushed by the frontend on a heartbeat.

    Companion to ``UserActivityTracker.push_external_system_signal()``
    (PR #1015 ``main_logic/activity/tracker.py:347``), exposing the
    push channel as HTTP for the "backend doesn't run on the user's
    machine" deployments. The frontend (Electron preload reading
    ``powerMonitor.getSystemIdleTime`` + npm ``active-win`` +
    ``os.cpus()`` + ``nvidia-smi``) POSTs here every ``~5s``; the
    tracker treats anything fresher than ``_EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_TTL_SECONDS``
    (15s) as the authoritative OS view, falling back to the local
    collector when the heartbeat stops. Same fresh-then-fallback path
    feeds both the async ``get_snapshot`` and the sync variant — see
    ``tracker._select_system_snapshot``.

    Auth:

    * Unified ``_validate_local_mutation_request`` guard (issue #1479
      Step 2): same Origin + ``X-CSRF-Token`` contract every other
      browser-facing mutation endpoint uses (seven-day-tutorial,
      screenshot, autostart-prompt, …). Replaces PR #1477's interim
      Origin-only gate. Same-origin Electron renderers and browser
      tabs send ``X-CSRF-Token`` via
      ``window.nekoLocalMutationSecurity`` (token is exposed by
      ``GET /api/config/page_config``); curl / Electron main-process /
      native scripts that don't run the token bootstrap are now
      rejected because *CSRF ≠ authentication* — pushing activity
      from outside the same browsing context isn't a supported path
      (see ``docs/design/security/local-mutation-auth.md`` for the
      threat model). The guard already rejects ``Origin: null`` /
      opaque origins because ``_normalize_origin_value`` returns
      ``""`` for them, which then fails the membership check.
    * Per-lanlan 5s rate limit below + the tracker's per-character
      lookup raise spam cost and bound the impact even if the guard
      somehow passes.

    Body fields (all optional except ``lanlan_name``):
      * ``lanlan_name`` (required) — which character's tracker to update
      * ``window_title`` — string, raw active-window title
      * ``process_name`` — string, owning process exe name (e.g. ``"Code.exe"``)
      * ``idle_seconds`` — float ≥ 0, OS-wide keyboard/mouse idle
      * ``cpu_avg_30s`` — float in ``[0, 100]``, rolling CPU average
      * ``gpu_utilization`` — float in ``[0, 100]``, primary GPU utilisation

    Returns 200 on success, 400 on malformed payload, 403 on
    Origin/CSRF rejection, 404 if ``lanlan_name`` isn't registered,
    429 if pushed faster than ``_EXTERNAL_SIGNAL_MIN_INTERVAL`` (5s),
