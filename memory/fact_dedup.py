FactDedupResolver — vector-aware deduplication of newly-written facts.

The flow is intentionally LLM-arbitrated, NOT auto-merge on cosine
threshold:

  1. The embedding-worker sweep computes a vector for each fact and,
     while it has both old and new vectors in hand, scans for
     cosine > FACT_DEDUP_COSINE_THRESHOLD against existing facts of
     the same entity.  Hits go into ``facts_pending_dedup.json``.
     The queue is **ids-only**: fact text never lands in the sidecar
     file. Scoped (group/member-derived) fact text must not exist in
     any store outside facts.json itself — the queue used to carry
     denormalized ``candidate_text`` / ``existing_text`` copies, which
     both leaked member content into a second plaintext file and went
     stale when the authoritative row was edited between enqueue and
     resolve.
  2. The idle-maintenance loop periodically calls ``aresolve(name)``,
     which re-reads the current text for each queued id pair from
     facts.json (a row that disappeared meanwhile is consumed via the
     stale-pair path) and batches the queue into one LLM call asking
     the model to classify each (candidate, existing) pair as
     ``merge`` / ``replace`` / ``keep_both``.
  3. Decisions are applied to facts.json under the FactStore's
     existing per-character file lock, then processed queue items
     are removed.

Why an LLM is in the loop:

  * Cosine alone can't distinguish "主人喜欢猫" (the user likes cats) from
    "主人讨厌猫" (the user hates cats).
    Both surface forms vary by 1 token but ride opposite poles.
  * Hash-based dedup remains the first line of defence (catches exact
    repeats, no LLM cost). Everything past that arrives here as a
    *candidate*, from either of two detectors:

      - the embedding sweep above (cosine), and
      - the FTS5 near-duplicate check in ``memory/facts.py`` (character
        n-gram overlap), which enqueues its hits instead of dropping the
        new fact — "养了一只猫" / "养了一只狗" ("got a cat" / "got a
        dog") is the highest textual overlap two facts can plausibly
        have and must still end in keep_both.

    The two detectors overlap on purpose and rarely agree at the edges;
    ``aenqueue_candidates`` dedups by id pair, so a pair both find is
    arbitrated once.

The FTS detector needs no vectors, so a character with the
EmbeddingService disabled still gets paraphrase consolidation here —
what it loses is the *paraphrase* class the embedding sweep is for
("对猫咪很感兴趣" / "最近养了只猫", "very interested in cats" /
"recently got a cat"), which shares almost no surface text and only a
vector can reach.

        Decision vocabulary:
          * ``merge``    — drop the candidate, bump existing.importance
                           by +1 (capped at 10), append candidate_id
                           to existing.merged_from_ids
          * ``replace``  — drop the existing, keep the candidate
                           (paraphrase but the new wording is better)
          * ``keep_both``— no mutation, just clear from queue (LLM
                           judged they're not actually duplicates)

        Decisions referencing ids that no longer exist (e.g. a
        concurrent /process absorbed them) are silently skipped —
        the next sweep will re-enqueue if the situation recurs.

        Conflict avoidance (Codex PR-957 P1): if the LLM returns
        reciprocal decisions in the same batch — e.g. ``merge`` for
        (c1, e1) (drop c1) and ``replace`` for (e1, c1) (drop e1) —
        a naive "remove all ids in ids_to_remove at the end" would
        delete BOTH facts and leave the user with nothing.  The
        defensive guard is an in-loop check: if either side of the
        current pair is already scheduled for removal by a prior
        decision, skip this decision entirely.  The earlier decision
        wins (LLM ordering matters); the conflicting pair is still
        consumed (so the next round doesn't keep flagging it).

        Returns ``(applied_count, processed_pair_keys)``.  The set
        contains the full scoped pair keys for queue entries the caller should
        *remove* — exactly the entries we
        applied or consumed via the conflict guard, NOT the ones we
        skipped due to malformed LLM output (those stay queued for
        retry).
