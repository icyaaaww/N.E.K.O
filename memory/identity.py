"""Two-layer speaker identity: ``entity`` (a person) <- ``account`` (a credential).

Pure functions, zero I/O. Everything stateful lives in :mod:`memory.trust_store`.

WHY TWO LAYERS. An entity is a person; an account is one credential that person
holds. The system only ever observes credentials, never people:

1. Every inbound message carries a credential, never a person. With only an
   entity layer, each unseen id forces a choice between "this is a new person"
   (which just renames account) and *guessing* which known person it is — and
   guessing means nickname matching or co-occurrence heuristics, which are
   categorically forbidden here (see the kill list in ``memory.trust_store``).
2. Permissions are granted to credentials, not to people. Admin in a QQ group
   does not imply admin on another platform; deriving one from the other makes
   the weakest integration the entry point for the whole system. So "what you
   were granted" lives on the account and only "what you earned" lives on the
   entity.
3. Assertions can be wrong, and a wrong one must be revocable. Revoking
   requires naming exactly what an account takes with it. A per-entity total
   has no answer to that question — not a hard one, *no* answer. Per-account
   partitioning makes unbind a byte-exact move of one sub-record.
4. The isolation unit of memory is "who spoke where", and the speaker is always
   a credential.

DETERMINISTIC DERIVATION HAS A PRECONDITION. ``derive_entity_id`` is a pure
function of ``(account_id, generation)`` — no allocator, no lock, no
write-before-persist window, and a lost pool file can be recomputed offline.
That only stays correct while **the derivation input is the sole truth of
identity**. Anyone adding a second identity dimension to the derivation must
first answer: can two accounts that differ on that dimension derive to the same
entity_id? If yes, deterministic derivation stops being a convenience and
starts *actively manufacturing* wrong merges.

``account_id`` IS ``stable_speaker_id`` OUTPUT, BYTE FOR BYTE. Never fold case,
never add a reserved-platform blacklist, never splice a channel into it. Three
SHA256 ledgers bake it in (``trust_event_id`` third arg, ``signal_identity``
source_id, the plugin's activity id), and ``memory/facts.py``'s
``_reconcile_existing_provenance`` turns any byte change into a permanent
``speaker_provenance_mixed`` stamp on the historical row — an absorbing state
with no clearing path anywhere in the repo, which also permanently retires that
row from trust signalling. That is memory-corpus damage, and neither ``unbind``
nor any linking mechanism can reach it.

    * Per-account clamping of ``adjustment`` would make the displacement
      ceiling ``±0.30·N`` — at N=2 that is already 4× the arbitration margin,

    * Averaging is rejected outright: ``mean(adj)`` lets someone dilute one
      correction to ``−0.08/N`` by binding clean accounts, turning bind into a
      laundering tool. Addition plus a single clamp is the only shape that
      defends against farming and laundering at once.
