    whichever half the reviewer wasn't looking at. Only the token-counting

    entry per authorized PARTICIPANT, in the order the CALLER supplied, plus
    a trailing ``None`` slot when legacy-private rows are also allowed in.
    Empty means legacy mode — one shared pool, pre-existing behaviour.

    ``marker_aliases`` maps every member marker of a participant onto that
    participant's primary marker. It is empty (identity) unless the caller
    supplied participant groups, so every pre-existing caller renders exactly
    as before. With it, one person holding several accounts gets ONE budget

        entries that live in the `_personas` in-memory view and therefore

        Callers should pass `writeback=False` for entries that do not have
        a process-resident view (currently: reflection entries, which are

        free — but we never pollute the entry dict with fields that
        wouldn't survive the next render anyway.

        Cache hit requires BOTH fingerprints to match:
        - text sha256 (catches text mutation)
        - tokenizer identity (catches tiktoken↔heuristic transition;
          see `utils.tokenize.tokenizer_identity` docstring for the
          motivating scenario — packaging without encoding data file).

        Additionally, `token_count` must coerce cleanly to a non-negative

        non-numeric or negative value with fingerprints that still happen
        to match (or match after someone also hand-rewrote the sha256
        field) — in which case `int(...)` on the cached value would
        either raise or return garbage and bomb the render. On coercion
        failure we treat it as a cache miss and recompute.

        The loop used to `break` there, which turned "the top-ranked entry
        is longer than the whole budget" into "the entire section
        disappears" — not a shortened persona, an absent one. A single
        over-long merged entry at rank 1 was enough to do it, and the
        lower-ranked entries that would have fitted never got a look.

        `entries` is a list of dicts (no entity tagging — caller sorts/keys
        as needed). Returns `(kept, tokens_used)`, the kept subset
        preserving the score-DESC order plus the tokens it consumed — the
        per-subject allocator needs the usage to hand what is left of the
        overall gate to the next subject.

        Two budgets, because the caller has two different ceilings and
        they are denominated differently:

        - `budget` is the per-subject pool, measured in entry TEXT. Same
          meaning in every mode, scoped or legacy, so one constant does
          not mean two things.
        - `gate_budget` (optional) is what is left of the scoped overall
          gate, measured in RENDERED tokens — text plus
          `per_entry_overhead`, the `- ` bullet and its newline that
          composition adds. With short facts that markup is most of the
          line, so a gate counting text alone is not a bound at all.

        An entry is taken only if it fits BOTH. Charging markup against
        the pool instead (the previous shape) quietly shrank every scoped
        subject's allowance below the number the constant advertises;
        selecting on text and charging markup afterwards (the shape before
        that) let one pool hand the next one tokens the gate no longer
        had. Legacy passes neither and is bit-for-bit unchanged.

        Returns the RENDERED cost, since that is what the gate is debited
        by; the pool is per-subject and reset each time.

        `cache_writeback`: default True writes `token_count` fields back
        onto each entry for across-render reuse (persona path — entries
        live in `_personas`). Pass False for reflection entries, which are
        loaded fresh from disk every render and would have no persistent
        view to cache against; writing cache fields there would be
        misleading and pollute reflection.json on the next save.
