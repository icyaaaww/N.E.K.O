"""Resolve subjects into participants. The ONLY subject-layer trust_store importer.

ONE SENTENCE: the stored bytes of ``subject_id`` / ``scope`` never change.
"One entity has exactly one participant per conversation" is implemented in the
server's RESOLUTION layer — an incoming request folds its subject slots by
participant, a read expands each participant into a set of markers, and a write
routes the subject to one sealed canonical account. The plugin side changes not
at all.

THREE STRUCTURAL PRECONDITIONS (each verified against the code):

1. The server never cross-checks ``segment.speaker_id`` against a subject's
   third segment. They are independent wire fields, and ``memory/scopes.py``
   puts no constraint on the CONTENT of a ``group_participant``'s third segment
   beyond "three non-empty parts". Rewriting it is therefore structurally legal
   and needs zero validation changes.
2. Attribution has exactly one entry point, ``entry_matches_subject``, whose
   semantics are byte equality of ``(key, scope)`` — no aliases, no prefixes, no
   normalization. Its set form is a membership test, so a WIDER marker set costs
   O(1) to filter.
3. "Read several subjects and merge" is already a shipped production path
   (``scoped_context`` / ``query_memory`` / ``scoped_mentions``, each 1..8).
   Nothing new has to be invented.

THREE RULES THAT ARE EASY TO BREAK AND FATAL IF BROKEN
======================================================

**N-1 — domain restriction.** Folding and canonical routing apply ONLY to
default-scope subjects (``scope == f"{kind}:{subject_id}"``); anything else is
an identity no-op. (a) The plugin never sends a scope, so 100% of production
traffic is default-scope and the restriction costs nothing real; (b) a custom
scope is an isolation boundary the caller declared explicitly, and silently
redirecting it would void that boundary on their behalf; (c) the two subject
foldings already in the tree (``_fact_dedup_domain``, ``_in_signal_scope``) are
likewise default-scope-only, so this introduces no third dialect.

**N-2 — canonical must RE-DERIVE its scope.** ``MemorySubject`` is frozen+slots,
so the handy way to rewrite ``subject_id`` is ``dataclasses.replace`` — and that
keeps the OLD scope. Since attribution is byte equality of the ``(key, scope)``
PAIR, a replace-built subject lands in nobody's marker set, and every newly
written row becomes an orphan readable by no one: precisely the opposite of the
point. Canonical subjects are therefore always rebuilt through the
``MemorySubject.group_participant`` / ``.participant`` / ``.group_chat``
constructors, which derive the scope. ``dataclasses.replace`` is banned in this
module and there is a grep guard test for it.

**N-3 — expansion must be defensive.** ``stable_speaker_id`` allows a colon
inside the actor, while ``group_participant`` demands exactly three segments.
Recombining ``(platform, conversation, actor)`` can therefore raise
``MemoryScopeError``; those combinations are DROPPED and counted, never allowed
to 500 the whole read path.

NO READ-SIDE TRUNCATION (M-1). ``members`` is every account of the participant.
Any "take the first K" rule would make "starting from A₁" and "starting from A₅"
produce structurally unequal groups that value-dedup cannot rescue, and would
make one marker belong to two groups. The bound lives at bind time instead
(``IDENTITY_MAX_ACCOUNTS_PER_ENTITY_PER_PLATFORM``, 409 on overflow), which is
an acceptable failure mode for a rare human action in a way read-time
truncation is not.
