"""Server-authoritative speaker-trust pool, keyed by platform-neutral account id.

FOUR RULES THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE
========================================

1. **The only writer is a memory_server handler.** Plugins, the dashboard and
   the migration path all go through HTTP; nothing else may touch the file.
   Every write is one synchronous critical section handed to a single
   ``asyncio.to_thread``.

2. **The pool must be a FLAT file at the memory_dir root.** A subdirectory such
   as ``memory/_trust/`` is silently ``rmtree``-d by the cloudsave import
   cleanup (``utils/cloudsave_runtime/operations.py``: ``delete_dir_targets``
   takes every child dir not in the imported-character set), while
   ``delete_file_targets`` only ever names ``memory/<character>/<whitelisted
   leaf>``. A root-level flat file dodges both. Precedent:
   ``app/memory_server/gates.py``'s ``idle_maintenance_state.json``. Any future
   sharding must stay flat: ``speaker_trust.<n>.json``, never a directory.

3. **The path carries no ``lanlan_name`` — cross-character sharing is the
   product decision, not a bug.** Trust answers "is this person reliable", which
   is a property of the person, not of their relationship with one character.
   The write happens inside a per-character route, and the target file
   deliberately is not per-character.

4. **The entity layer decides whether an event is PRODUCED, never whose ledger
   it lands in.** ``trust_event_id`` bakes the target account into its SHA256
   and the plugin's activity ids bake the source account in, so an id aimed at
   A is structurally impossible inside B's ring. Unioning rings across an
   entity buys zero deduplication and destroys ``unbind``'s ability to know
   what an account takes with it. Entity resolution is allowed to change which
   signals get generated (the self-attestation ban); once generated, idempotency
   and storage are 100% per-account.

EXPLICIT KILL LIST — never derive an entity edge from any of these
=================================================================
1. Display name / nickname / group card. The two QQ transports read them in
   OPPOSITE priority order, the card is group-scoped, and users can change them.
2. Bootstrap elevation. Its trigger is "the user list is empty", a configuration
   state, not proof of identity.
3. Temporal adjacency — whoever speaks first after a transport switch.
4. Any edit distance / similarity / shape heuristic.
5. ``channel`` itself. It is an observed attribute, not identity evidence.

The number of automatic bind code paths is zero, and that is a structural
property: ``_bind_locked`` / ``_merge_entities_locked`` are reachable only from
the four human-triggered identity endpoints. There is a guard test asserting
that call-site count.

BARRIERS ARE ACCOUNT-LOCAL WHILE ``trust_inputs`` IS ENTITY-GLOBAL
=================================================================
This asymmetry is deliberate and a reader will reasonably assume otherwise.
``barrier_pending(platform(account_id))`` only inspects the requesting side. An
entity holding a cleared ``qq:``  account and a pending ``bili:`` one resolves
normally on QQ (bounded under-count until the bili ledger imports; fail-closed,
self-heals when the barrier opens) and abstains on bili. There is no
double-count path, because the pending platform's write side is skipped too.
The alternative reading — "any pending platform makes the whole person abstain"
— would make onboarding a new platform instantly strip that person's trust
everywhere they were already established.

MINIMAL INTEGRATION SURFACE FOR A NEW PLATFORM
==============================================
Per ``scoped_history`` request, a platform plugin supplies only:

1. a ``platform`` token matching ``[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+`` (lowercased server-side);
2. ``speaker_id = f"{platform}:{actor}"`` where actor matches
   ``[A-Za-z0-9_.:@-]+``, total length <= 96, and actor is a **stable
   platform-side id, never a nickname** (a ``uid if uid > 0 else uname``
   fallback is judged ``None`` by ``stable_speaker_id`` and silently dropped);
3. a base source, exactly one of ``speaker_tier`` (four-tier platforms) or
   ``speaker_base_trust`` (0..1, clamped server-side, for tier-less platforms);
4. ``speaker_is_owner``, derivable only from an explicit stable-id binding with
   ``tier == "admin"`` — the server 422s any other combination;
5. ``speaker_label`` / ``display_name`` (cosmetic);
6. optionally ``speaker_activity_events``: ``[{"id", "count"}]`` with ids that
   stay stable across retries and restarts.

It supplies NO storage, ledger, idempotency ring, writer lock, transaction
lock, event application logic, response handling, or migration.

    sample, no counter. A caller that wanted to infer could not express it

    and the bind then 404s with "unknown entity" -- which sends the operator
