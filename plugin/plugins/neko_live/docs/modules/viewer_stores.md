# Viewer And Security Stores

## Purpose

This store slice keeps viewer profiles, audit events, and encrypted platform credentials behind explicit single-writer boundaries. It adds safe profile projections and maintenance actions, bounded audit records with secret redaction, and isolated credential namespaces for multiple live providers.

## Ownership And Contracts

- `stores/viewer_store.py` is the only writer for `viewer_profiles.json`. It sanitizes loaded records, serializes writes with an async lock, uses atomic replacement, removes failed-write temporary files, and exposes recent, reset, delete, and clear operations whose results report whether persistence was applied. Storage status follows the file actually in use after a custom-directory fallback and treats a creatable nested directory as writable without creating it during a read-only status check. The three-second live dashboard poll reuses at most 200 deep-copied public recent-profile projections while the canonical file signature is unchanged; it never caches the complete profile database or bypasses the JSON writer.
- `stores/audit_store.py` is the only audit-event sink. It bounds text, nesting, and list sizes and redacts sensitive text and structured sensitive keys.
- `stores/credential_store.py` owns Fernet-encrypted credential files. The default `bili` namespace preserves legacy filenames while other providers use strictly validated, isolated filenames and field allowlists. Audit identity uses `DedeUserID` for Bili fields and `uid` for provider field sets that expose it; missing identities are recorded explicitly as `unidentified`, never as an empty account id.
- `core/viewer_preferences.py` owns preference inference and the public profile projection returned by `recent_profiles()`.

Store callers receive plain public dictionaries or contract objects. Viewer mutations require a sanitized provider identity. This identity is part of the existing product contract: `viewer_profiles.json` uses the sanitized value both as the JSON key and as the profile `uid` field; it is not an opaque or cross-provider anonymous identifier. Bili credential audit identity uses `DedeUserID`, while other provider credential fields use an allowlisted `uid` when available. Removing or hashing this persistent profile identity requires a separate schema migration; disabling personalized memory does not rewrite existing identity keys. Credential callers only receive the configured encrypted payload fields.

## Pipeline, Safety, And Data

Viewer data is derived from compact identity and interaction metadata after normal live-event handling. Store operations do not emit NEKO output. Any response using profile guidance still enters `core/pipeline.py`, passes `core/safety_guard.py`, and reaches NEKO only through `adapters/neko_dispatcher.py`.

Viewer profiles contain local nicknames, avatar URLs, counters, compact preference summaries, and recent output summaries. Audit records must never retain cookies, tokens, authorization values, or provider credentials. Credential plaintext exists only in memory during encrypted save/load and must never enter audit, logs, config, or UI.

Personalized viewer memory defaults to enabled. The switch controls only safe-derived preference learning and prompt use; basic identity, interaction counters, first-roast state, and same-session anti-repeat remain active. Profiles expire after 90 days of inactivity and are pruned lazily at startup and during normal store traffic. The store never keeps raw danmaku text or adds a background cleanup loop.

## Decision Point: Viewer Memory V1

- **Approved product behavior:** default on; fixed 90-day retention; ordinary-user toggle, clear-all, reset-impression, and delete-profile controls.
- **Cost budget:** bounded local JSON I/O and existing prompt tokens only when enabled. No background timer, network request, dependency, raw-message archive, `watch_time`, or `contribution_rank`.
- **Action semantics:** reset removes only derived impressions and preserves identity, counts, and first-roast state; delete removes the complete persistent UID record and its session claim; clear-all affects profiles only, not summaries, sandbox results, or safety queues.
- **Rejected alternatives:** disabling the basic profile store with personalization would break first-roast dedup; background retention jobs add idle cost; retaining raw history increases privacy and migration risk.
- **Degrade / rollback:** setting `viewer_memory_enabled=false` immediately stops learning and prompt use while preserving the basic live contract. Existing JSON remains schema-compatible if the UI controls are rolled back.
- **Evidence:** config projection, disabled-learning, prompt gating, 90-day pruning, reset/delete/clear, panel parity, locale, and full plugin gates cover this decision.

## Testing

Run:

```powershell
uv run pytest plugin/plugins/neko_live/tests/test_viewer_store.py plugin/plugins/neko_live/tests/test_credential_store.py plugin/plugins/neko_live/tests/test_audit_store.py -q
uv run pytest plugin/plugins/neko_live/tests -q --maxfail=1
uv run python -m plugin.neko_plugin_cli.cli check plugin/plugins/neko_live
```

Tests cover JSON persistence and fallback, disabled-memory behavior, 90-day retention, profile reset/delete/clear behavior, prompt gating, encrypted namespace isolation, and redaction of secrets in text and nested structured audit detail.

## Limitations And Rollback

- Viewer profiles are local plugin data and do not provide cross-device synchronization.
- Profile mutations still read and atomically rewrite the canonical JSON file. The bounded dashboard projection removes repeated read/parse work but does not turn JSON into an indexed database; very large 90-day profile sets may still add latency to an individual selected interaction. A storage-engine migration remains a separate decision.
- Ordinary profile updates degrade to the plugin data directory when a configured viewer directory cannot be written. Destructive maintenance actions report `applied: false` instead of claiming fallback-only persistence while a stale configured source remains authoritative.
- Missing or undecryptable credential files degrade to a logged-out state.
- Rolling back the maintenance APIs leaves existing profile JSON compatible. Rolling back provider namespaces must retain the default `bili_credential.*` files; other namespace files can remain unused without exposing plaintext.
