"""Ratchet: no NEW non-ASCII filenames in anything bundled into the desktop app.

Why this exists
---------------
Nuitka ``--mode=app`` puts the whole payload under
``projectneko_server.app/Contents/MacOS/``. codesign's default bundle rules
(``rules2``) classify everything under that directory as *nested code*::

    ^(Frameworks|SharedFrameworks|PlugIns|Plug-ins|XPCServices|Helpers|MacOS|
      Library/(Automator|Spotlight|LoginItems))/   =>   nested

So every .mp3 / .png / .json we ship is signed as its own code object, and for
each one codesign writes a designated requirement into
``Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources``::

    identifier <name> and anchor apple generic and certificate ...

When the filename is non-ASCII, codesign emits that identifier as a **hex
literal** instead of a quoted string::

    identifier 0xe4b883e5a4a9e5898defbc8ce68891e4bbace8bf98e58faae698afe7a...

That is not valid requirement syntax. Reading the seal back fails, and the
whole bundle then verifies as::

    <app>: the sealed resource directory is invalid

…which blocks signing, notarization, and Steam upload. One such file poisons
the entire bundle; the error names no path, so it is genuinely painful to
diagnose from scratch.

Why CI can never catch it on its own
------------------------------------
``.github/workflows/build-desktop.yml`` signs ad-hoc::

    codesign --force --deep --sign - dist/Xiao8/projectneko_server.app

Ad-hoc signatures use ``cdhash H"..."`` requirements, which carry no
identifier at all — so the hex-literal bug simply does not occur there and
the workflow is always green. The breakage only appears on the local
Developer ID signing path (``build_mac.sh``). This lint is the substitute for
a signal CI structurally cannot produce.

What it scans
-------------
Only what actually ships:

- files git knows about under the bundled roots (``BUNDLED_ROOTS``) —
  tracked plus untracked-but-not-ignored, so the check fires before
  ``git add`` rather than only after commit;
- ``filename`` values in the manifests that drive build-time downloads
  (``main_logic/asr_client/*/models/manifest.json``): the ``.onnx`` itself is
  gitignored and only exists after a build, but the name it will be written
  under is committed, so a plain CI run can still catch it;
- member names inside the archives that get unpacked into those roots at
  build time (``assets/*.tar.gz`` -> ``static/<model>/`` via
  ``build_frontend.sh``; the PNGTuber packs named by
  ``frontend/pngtuber-packs/manifest.json`` -> ``static/pngtuber/<folder>/``
  via ``scripts/unpack_builtin_pngtuber.py``). Reading member names needs no
  build and no extraction, so the check gives the same answer in a fresh
  checkout as on a build machine. Hard-link and symlink members count too:
  ``tar -xzm`` materializes them as entries under ``static/`` like any file.

Asking git (rather than walking the working tree) keeps the result
deterministic: gitignored build outputs, downloaded model weights, and local
runtime files never make the answer wander between a fresh checkout and a
built one. Pass ``--include-untracked`` to additionally walk the on-disk tree
— useful right after a build, when you want to sanity-check generated payload
too.

Only **basenames** are checked, not whole paths. codesign derives the nested
identifier from the filename alone, so a non-ASCII *directory* holding
ASCII-named files signs and verifies cleanly (checked against a real
Developer ID certificate: ``MacOS/<cjk-dir>/plain_name.png`` seals as
``identifier "plain_name"`` and passes ``--verify --deep --strict``).
Flagging those too would only produce failures nobody can act on.

``tests/`` is deliberately out of scope: it carries a few CJK fixture paths
and never reaches the .app.

Baseline
--------
338 tracked files plus 1 archive member are already non-ASCII when this check
was written, across three unrelated subsystems:

- ``static/assets/tutorial/guide-audio/{zh,ja,ko,ru,en}/*.mp3`` — filenames
  are truncated line transcripts, referenced from the ``audioFilesByKey``
  manifests in ``static/tutorial/yui-guide/days/*.js``;
- ``static/vrm/motion/**``, ``static/vrm/animation/*``,
  ``static/mmd/animation/*`` — ``static/vrm/motion/manifest.json`` states the
  convention outright (``"fileNaming": "descriptive Chinese filename with
  stable id"``, ``"authoritativeLanguage": "zh-CN"``), because motion lookup
  runs through Chinese action-card retrieval;
- ``static/game/games/soccer/audio/*.mp3``, plus one Live2D expression file
  under ``static/yui-origin/expressions/`` that ships inside
  ``assets/yui-origin.tar.gz`` and is named from the ``.model3.json``.

Renaming those is a product decision, not a mechanical sweep — the VRM naming
scheme in particular is load-bearing for motion retrieval. So this is a
ratchet, not a clean-room ban: everything listed in
``scripts/nonascii_asset_baseline.txt`` is grandfathered, anything new fails.

TODO: shrink the baseline. Each family needs its own follow-up — rename the
files to ASCII (stable slug or id) and update the manifest that names them.
An empty baseline is the goal; when it gets there, delete the file and make
this a plain ban.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/check_no_nonascii_asset_names.py
    python scripts/check_no_nonascii_asset_names.py --list
    python scripts/check_no_nonascii_asset_names.py --include-untracked
    python scripts/check_no_nonascii_asset_names.py --update-baseline
    python scripts/check_no_nonascii_asset_names.py --base origin/main

The baseline is a ratchet in both directions of attack: ``--update-baseline``
only ever drops entries that no longer exist, and ``--base`` fails when the
committed list gained a line relative to that ref. Without the second one the
first is only a convention — adding the asset and its baseline entry in the
same PR leaves nothing for the in-tree comparison to see.
