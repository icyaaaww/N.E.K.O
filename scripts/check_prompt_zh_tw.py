"""Stop new i18n prompt dicts from landing without a 'zh-TW' key (issue #2500).

A dict under config/prompts/ that has an 'en' key plus 'zh' or 'zh-CN' is a
localized prompt table. Most of them predate Traditional Chinese support, and
`_loc` falls back to 'en' rather than 'zh' on a missing key, so a zh-TW user who
reaches such a dict gets an English prompt.

Backfilling the existing tables is a batched effort tracked in issue #2500. This
gate only stops the hole from growing.

How the ratchet works
=====================
It counts offending dicts at the merge-base and at HEAD. HEAD having more than
the base is what fails the check. That is the whole decision — no source lines,
no per-dict identity, no grouping.

Getting here took three wrong turns, each of which broke a case the simple count
handles for free:

  * **By diff line.** A pre-existing ``{'en': ..., 'ja': ...}`` table that a PR
    turns into a localized one by adding a single ``'zh'`` line never has its own
    definition line in the diff — the gate would miss the very case it exists
    for. And renaming a module with no content change marks every line of the
    new path as added, reporting the whole file's existing backlog.
  * **By whole key set.** Then adding an unrelated locale (a new ``'fr'``
    template) to a pre-existing offender reads as a brand-new table, failing a
    PR that did not grow the backlog.
  * **By Simplified-key scheme** ('zh' vs 'zh-CN' counted separately). Then
    migrating a table from ``'zh'`` to ``'zh-CN'`` shows up as one scheme losing
    a table and the other gaining one, and Counter subtraction only keeps the
    positive side — so it reports growth that did not happen. issue #2500's own
    endgame is exactly that rename across all ~339 tables, i.e. this gate would
    have blocked the migration it exists to serve.

A plain total is invariant under all three: renames, copy edits, added locales,
and scheme migrations all leave it alone, while a table newly subject to the rule
raises it.

The tradeoff: a PR removing one offending table while adding another nets to zero
and passes. That is a deliberate accept — the alternative is matching dicts
across revisions by identity, and every candidate for that identity (position,
key set, scheme) is what the three wrong turns above already tried.

What this gate promises, and what it asks of you instead
=======================================================
It reads the shapes prompt modules actually use -- a dict literal, ``dict()``,
``|``, a comprehension, an iterable of pairs, ``dict.fromkeys``, and the
statement-level backfills around them (``T["zh-TW"] = ...``, ``update()``,
``setdefault()``, ``|=``, and the removals that undo them).

It does **not** try to be a Python interpreter. When a table is assembled in a
way it cannot prove statically, the answer is not a smarter analysis; it is one
of two things you do to the code:

  * write the table in one of the canonical shapes above, or
  * put ``# noqa: PROMPT_ZH_TW`` on it, which is a one-line, greppable record
    that a human decided this table is out of scope.

That line is the design, not a shortfall. Every extra construct taught to the
resolver buys a case nobody writes and costs a rule that can misfire on the
~339 tables this gate actually watches; the escape hatch costs one comment.
Reviewers who find a shape it does not resolve should reach for the hatch, not
for another branch here.

Scope: one expression at a time, plus one cross-statement exemption
==================================================================
A table assembled across statements is not judged::

    T = {"en": "e"}
    T["zh"] = "s"          # T now needs zh-TW, and this gate will not say so

Judging that needs intra-procedural data flow — binding names to mapping state,
then following subscript assignments, ``update()`` calls and ``|=`` through
scopes, aliases, branches and loops. So mutation *payloads* are suppressed as
fragments (alone they say nothing about the assembled table) and the assembled
table goes unjudged. Same family as the "unknowable keys stay silent" rule.

The one cross-statement case that *is* handled is the false-positive direction::

    T = {"en": "e", "zh": "s"}
    T.update({"zh-TW": "t"})    # or T["zh-TW"] = ..., or T |= {...}

That table is compliant at runtime, so reporting it would be a false positive —
and false positives are what get a gate worked around rather than satisfied. The
exemption is deliberately keyed on the mutation *demonstrably supplying zh-TW*:
exempting on any mutation would let an unrelated ``T["other"] = x`` excuse a real
offender, trading one rare false positive for a broad blind spot.

Six accepted blind spots:

  * The exemption is not ordered against *other* uses of the name, so a copy taken
    before the backfill is not judged::

        T = {"en": "e", "zh": "s"}
        U = dict(T)              # U really does lack zh-TW at runtime
        T["zh-TW"] = "t"         # …but this exempts T's literal, and dict(T)
                                 #    resolves through the name to the same keys

    Ordering the exemption against each use needs statement-level data flow, the
    same analysis the section above declines.
  * ``dict(zip(keys, values))`` is not resolved. Every other static constructor is
    (literal, ``dict()``, ``|``, comprehension, iterable-of-pairs, ``fromkeys``),
    but splitting a localized table into two parallel sequences makes the template
    bodies unreadable, so it is not a shape prompt modules use — there are zero
    occurrences under config/prompts. Chasing constructor forms with no realistic
    use grows ``resolve_keys`` without shrinking the backlog.
  * Bindings are ordered by source position, with no scope or reachability
    analysis. Two functions that each bind a local ``T`` share one timeline, and a
    backfill written inside a function nobody calls counts as if it ran. Both
    follow from the same choice the section above states: a mutation and the
    binding it mutates sit in the same scope in practice, and prompt modules are
    tables at import time, not call graphs.
  * A removal that reaches the table through a different name is not seen::

        T = {"en": "e", "zh": "s"}
        A = T                    # same object
        T["zh-TW"] = "t"
        A.pop("zh-TW")           # …so this really does un-complete T

    Knowing that A and T are the same object is alias analysis -- a set of names
    per object, maintained across rebinding -- rather than the per-name timeline
    everything else here uses.
  * ``for`` targets and ``popitem()`` are not read at all. A loop target's
    bindings are alternatives rather than a sequence, and only a backfill inside
    the body reaches them all; which key ``popitem()`` removes depends on the
    dict's insertion order. Both were supported for one round and both produced
    follow-up defects — a backfill through one loop target excusing another's
    tables, and ``popitem()`` revoking an exemption for a table that was still
    compliant. Neither shape occurs under config/prompts, so the gate stays with
    what it can prove and the escape hatch covers the rest.
  * A table assembled from fragments that are each *individually* fine is not
    judged::

        EN = {"en": "e"}         # no simplified key — not an offender
        ZH = {"zh": "s"}         # no anchor key — not an offender
        T = EN | ZH              # the runtime table is one, and lacks zh-TW

    Judging the result would mean following names from ``_table_nodes``, which is
    the reverse of the union-style resolution used for the supply question: there,
    over-approximating is safe; here, a merge with one unknowable operand would be
    reported despite that operand possibly carrying zh-TW. Under config/prompts
    there are zero ``NAME | NAME`` merges, and the shape — one dict per locale,
    merged — is strictly more verbose than the single dict it replaces.


Usage:
    python scripts/check_prompt_zh_tw.py [--base origin/main]
    python scripts/check_prompt_zh_tw.py --full     # list the whole backlog
    python scripts/check_prompt_zh_tw.py --count    # backlog size only

Escape hatch: a ``noqa`` comment naming PROMPT_ZH_TW on the dict's opening or
closing line. It may sit in a comma-separated code list in any order, and a bare
``noqa`` suppresses everything — same behaviour as the sibling gates and ruff.
