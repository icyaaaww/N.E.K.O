"""Traditional-Chinese coverage for the emotion subsystem (issue #2500).

Two independent mechanisms are exercised here, and they fail differently:

* The heuristic keyword tables are flattened across *all* languages and matched as
  substrings against whatever the user typed, so a Traditional writer needs the
  Traditional forms present. No locale plumbing is involved — the table either has
  the characters or it does not.
* The two LLM prompt templates are dispatched by ``_loc``, which falls back to
  ``en`` on a missing key. Adding a ``zh-TW`` template is only half the fix: the
  call sites derive the locale from ``detect_language``, which cannot tell the two
  orthographies apart, so without ``detect_prompt_language`` the template stays
  unreachable and the tests below would pass on a template nobody ever sees.
