"""Foreground residency: the runtime never daemonizes and never outlives its owner.

Two kinds of test here, on purpose:

* **Real-process tests** for the guard itself. Whether a process actually dies
  when its parent does is an OS question; a mocked answer would only confirm what
  we already believe.
* **Contract tests** (source-level) for the *absence* of detachment primitives.
  A regression here is somebody re-adding ``setsid`` or ``DETACHED_PROCESS``
  somewhere new, which no behavioural test would catch until it shipped.
