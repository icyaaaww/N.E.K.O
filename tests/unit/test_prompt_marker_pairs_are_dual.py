"""A `======...======` block must open and close in the same wording family.

Project convention is below/above duality: `以下为X` closes with `以上为X`, never
with `以上是X`, and an English `Below is X` never closes with a Chinese footer.
The drift is invisible in review because opener and closer sit dozens of lines
apart inside one template, so it is checked mechanically instead.

Scope is deliberately the pairs that live inside a **single string constant**,
where opener and closer are unambiguously the two ends of one block. Tables that
put the opener in a header dict and the closer in a separate footer dict are not
covered here: nothing in the source says which header goes with which footer, so
pairing them would be a guess. Those are the `_INJECTION_*` header/footer dicts
in prompts_proactive.py.

Only the wording *family* is asserted, not the name after it. Several blocks
deliberately re-word the closer (`以下为近期搭话记录（你应该避免雷同…）` closes with
`以上为近期搭话记录（不可重复…）`, re-stating the constraint at both ends), so a
name-equality assertion would fight the prompt design rather than catch drift.

One closer is exempt: see `_WATERMARK_CLOSERS`.

The markers quoted above are the literals under test, so this docstring cannot
be written without them.
