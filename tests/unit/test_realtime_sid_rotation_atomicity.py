"""#2619: the speech-id rotation and the TTS-done ledger under cancellation.

``rotate_speech_id_for_response_done`` writes two TTS-done flags and then
rotates ``current_speech_id`` under ``self.lock``, and had no test of any kind.
The concern was that a cancellation between those writes leaves the host
saying "new turn" on the flags and "old turn" on the speech id.

What these tests pin:

* the rotation's contract, which nothing covered before;
* that the torn state is NOT reachable through the real lock, because no
  holder of ``self.lock`` suspends, so the acquire never yields and is not a
  cancellation point (the structural half of this lives in
  ``scripts/check_core_contracts.py::CORE_LOCK_NO_AWAIT``);
* what the residue WOULD be if that invariant were lost — the counterfactual
  is the reason the gate exists, so it is asserted rather than described;
* the window that was genuinely reachable: ``_clear_tts_pipeline`` sends
  ``__interrupt__`` and then sleeps 20ms, so a cancellation there used to
  leave an interrupted worker behind a ledger still claiming the done
  sentinel was queued — which makes the next turn's sentinel unsendable.
