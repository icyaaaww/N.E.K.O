"""Ownership of the shared voice-start slot.

``S.sessionStartedResolver`` / ``Rejecter`` / ``_pendingSessionStartMode`` are
ONE slot, and concurrent starts genuinely exist: the mic button, the composer's
text send, the avatar-drop text entry and the automatic reconnect restart can
all be in flight together. Every flow used to clear the slot unconditionally on
its way out, so whichever finished first wiped whoever owned it -- the newer
start then hung on a promise nobody would settle, or lost its timeout.

The owner token is the resolver function itself. These cases drive the real
helpers from app-state.js rather than asserting on source text, because the
property that matters is behavioural: a release by a superseded flow must be a
no-op.
