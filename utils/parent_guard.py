"""Foreground-residency guard: the runtime never outlives its owner.

``projectneko_server`` is a *foreground* process.  Whoever starts it — the
Electron desktop shell, a terminal, CI — owns it for its whole life.  Two rules
follow, and this module enforces the second one:

1. **Never daemonize.**  No ``setsid``, no ``DETACHED_PROCESS``, no re-parenting
   to init.  That is a property of how the launcher spawns things and lives in
   ``launcher_core.runtime``.
2. **Parent death is self-termination.**  If the owner disappears — clean exit,
   crash, ``SIGKILL``, power-cut of the UI process — the runtime tears its whole
   topology down instead of surviving as an orphan holding ports.

Rule 2 removes the need for an external anchor (a shell supervisor holding the
process group, a Windows Job holder owned by the parent, a persistent ownership
lease replayed on next boot).  Those exist only because a child could outlive
its parent; once it cannot, they have nothing left to recover.

Mechanisms, best-first per platform, all of them redundant on purpose:

============  ==========================================================
``pdeathsig`` Linux ``prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG)`` — kernel-delivered, instant.
``stdin_eof`` POSIX, when fd 0 is a pipe from the parent — instant, and the
              only instant mechanism available on macOS.
``parent_handle``
              Windows ``WaitForSingleObject`` on a handle to the parent,
              opened at install time and verified against process creation
              times so a recycled pid cannot be mistaken for the parent.
``ppid_poll`` POSIX backstop — notices re-parenting within one interval.
============  ==========================================================

Every mechanism funnels into one idempotent callback.  Arming zero mechanisms
is reported honestly via :attr:`ParentDeathGuard.mechanisms` rather than
pretending the guarantee holds.
