"""Single-instance self-proof for the N.E.K.O runtime.

The launcher used to let *observers* work out whether a runtime was already
alive: probe three default ports, demand a ``/health`` response on each, and
require all three to report the same ``instance_id``.  That is discovery-based
arbitration — it can only ever be a guess, it races with a runtime that is
half-way through binding its ports, and it forces every consumer (the Electron
shell most of all) to reimplement the same fragile inference.

This module replaces the inference with a *proof*:

* **Uniqueness** is held by an OS file lock (``flock`` on POSIX,
  ``msvcrt.locking`` on Windows) that is taken for the whole process lifetime.
  The kernel releases it when the holding process dies, however it dies, so
  there is no stale-lock recovery path to get wrong.
* **Identity** is published by the lock holder into a sibling JSON record:
  pid, parent pid, instance id, launch id, executable, negotiated ports.
  A reader never has to guess any of it.
* **Liveness of the record** is proven by the lock, not by the record: a record
  whose lock can be taken is by definition stale.  ``owner_status()`` returns
  ``owned`` / ``free`` / ``unknown`` and never collapses ``unknown`` into either
  of the other two.

Consumers that cannot take a POSIX/Windows file lock (notably the Electron
shell, which speaks Node) get the same proof in two cheaper forms: the launcher
mirrors the record onto stdout as a ``NEKO_EVENT``, so the normal spawn path
needs no file read at all, and the record carries ``owner_pid`` for the
file-based path.

Match ``owner_pid``, not ``parent_pid``.  ``parent_pid`` is only our immediate
parent, and that is not always the owner: measured on CI, ``Popen(sys.executable)``
on Windows starts a launcher shim that re-launches the real interpreter, so the
child's parent is the shim (macOS and Linux match directly).  A frozen build has
no shim, but a Windows dev run does — and an owner that matched ``parent_pid``
would fail to recognise a runtime that is genuinely its own.  ``owner_pid``
resolves from ``NEKO_OWNER_PID`` when the owner sets it, which is the reliable
answer on every platform; owners that want file-based recognition should set it.
