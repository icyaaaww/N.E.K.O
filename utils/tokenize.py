Token counting helpers for memory-evidence render budget (RFC §3.6.6).

Why a dedicated module:
- `tiktoken.get_encoding(...)` reads ~1.5 MB encoding files from disk on
  first call. We cache the resulting `Encoding` instance per encoding name
  so subsequent calls (~thousands per render) are pure CPU.
- `Encoding.encode` releases the GIL inside the Rust core (tiktoken 0.5+),
  but the FastAPI event loop still stalls if we call it directly from a
  coroutine. The async twin (`acount_tokens`) hops to `asyncio.to_thread`
  to keep the loop responsive.
- Packaging products (Nuitka / PyInstaller) sometimes ship without the
  `o200k_base.tiktoken` data file. The first time we fall back to a
  heuristic counter we emit a single warning so operators notice — RFC §8
  S13 mandates "no silent heuristic fallback in shipped binaries".
